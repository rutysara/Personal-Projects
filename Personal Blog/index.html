        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homepage: This should feature a brief introduction about yourself, your skills, and a call-to-action (CTA) to view your portfolio.</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>Portfolio: Create a dedicated page to showcase your projects. Include screenshots, descriptions, and links to the live websites or repositories on platforms like GitHub. You can categorize your projects (e.g., web applications, websites, mobile apps) to make it easier for visitors to browse.</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>Testimonials: If you have worked with clients or collaborators in the past, consider adding a testimonials section where they can share their positive experiences with your work.</li> <br>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose reliable web hosting. Use high-quality web hosting to ensure your web developer portfolio runs smoothly and quickly.
                <li>Pick the right domain name. The right domain name can make your portfolio more professional and memorable. Check its availability using a domain name search. Consider .com, .me, .dev, and .tech domain name extensions.
                <li>List specialized skills. Displaying your programming skills and web development experience is key. It is also a good idea to mention the education or web development certifications you’ve earned to add credibility.
                <li>Curate your projects. Display only your best work. If you’re an entry-level developer with little work experience, list open-source projects that you’ve contributed to.
                <li>Create an engaging design. A well-designed website can increase credibility and brand recognition. Also, show your personality through the site’s design to create a lasting impression.
                <li>Add social proof. Include testimonials from previous clients to build trust and catch the attention of potential employers.
                <li>Include a contact form. Since the purpose of your portfolio is to get more clients, place a contact form prominently on your site.
            </ul>
